\section{Problem statement}

I'm feeling incredibly frustrated with lockdown, and the state of the world in general. I'm 25 years old and facing a life in a concrete jungle with overpriced everything. I grew up in London and have always dreamed of leaving the city, I'm sure you'll understand how frustrating therefore having to come back to the big smoke for work is. Every day I go for a walk and must endure the constantly worsening air pollution. A home will cost me half a million quid, at least. The golden handcuffs of a life in tech are quite real.

There's got to be a better way.

Boats are normally considered a luxury for the rich and, when you're \textit{also} paying for a house on land and a slip in a marina they are. Oh, and boats require constant maintenance. This sounds like a recipe for disaster right? Wrong.

The reality of the situation is that when you're living on a boat you've removed the largest monthly expense anyone will likely ever have - rent. When you consider also that you're generating your own power (in a renewable way) the monthly expenses drop considerably. As an example, this random guy off the internet cruises at a cost of \$1000 a month on boat related expenses. This is \textit{less} than the rent I currently pay for a house I share with my housemate in West Ham. I've also got to pay for bills on top of that. plus there's commuting costs. \cite{sv-delos-budget}.
