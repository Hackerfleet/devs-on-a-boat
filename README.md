# Devs on a boat
This is intended to be a whitepaper discussing how one could make living in a boat full time and working as a developer a practical possibility.

Please excuse the mess this is in right now! I've very much been in the "throwing my thoughts on a page" step.

Apart from my dissertation I've never written a large document like this, please feel free to make suggestions for how the structure can be improved, especially as this grows.

I'm more than sure there will be things that are actively wrong and I'd be thrilled for these to be pointed out. I've been writing this document for my own use case (classic sailboat with an electric motor, ultimately designed to be able to cross oceans and work indefinitely from a remote destination) but now that this is a communal effort I think it's only proper to broaden this to describe a variety of approaches. More than happy to hear suggesions for how one would do this.

This document is written in Latex (pronounced Lay-tek). I'm open to using a different format but chose Latex as it's a common choice for whitepapers and has lots of nice features around referencing, typesetting, and making indexes - amongst other things. Markdown for example just doens't have this rich set of features although it is simpler to work with.

# Building
I'm using VSCode with [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) in case you've never worked with Latex before.

At some point I will set up some CI/CD to validate PR's and build a PDF off the master branch and post that somewhere for all to see. Currently one should just render the PDF using your favourite Latex editor.
