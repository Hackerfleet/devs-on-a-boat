### 4G

I anticipate that whenever conventional WiFi is not available, my primary
internet connection will be a load-balanced 4G connection, meaning I
would have up to double the bandwidth of a single 4G connection but with
identical latency.

This also provides provider-level redundancy as I would be able to take
advantage of competing, distinct networks. This has the added benefit of
my 4G coverage being better than that of any single 4G provider.

These considerations (along with hardware considerations) ensure that
the 4G connection itself is highly available, which would be imperative
in situations where WiFi was not available.

It is worth noting that 4G is generally unavailable beyond 15 miles / 25km offshore without
significantly uprated hardware, and not at all beyond 50 miles / 80km.
