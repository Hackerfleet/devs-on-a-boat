## 5G

### Low-Band 5G
Low-band 5G runs at approximately 600MHz, and can be expected to have the range of a UHF radio - e.g., line of sight. You'll likely be able to /hear/ cell towers
out to a theoretical maximum of 22 miles / 35 kilometers *from the nearest tower*, assuming an antenna mounted on your mast and a 100 ft cell tower, but actual performance will likely be *significantly* worse.

### Mid-Band 5G
Mid-band 5G runs at approximately 2.5-3.5 GHz, and can be expected to have single-digit mile/km ranges.

### High-Band 5G
High-band 5G signals run in millimeter-wave bands, and have ranges of approximately 1 mile.
