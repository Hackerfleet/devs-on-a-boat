## Emergencies

In an effort to minimise downside risk under any circumstance I will
have a small diesel generator on standby with enough fuel for 100%
utilisation for at least a week. This is incredibly conservative, and
doubles as redundant power for the electric motor if all other
safeguards fail.

(Note: It honestly may be simpler here to keep the diesel engine, especially
since running a ~3500W diesel generator 24/7 for a week requires storage of ~60 gallons / 227 liters
of diesel. The sailboat already comes with sufficient diesel in its tanks to run its motor.)
