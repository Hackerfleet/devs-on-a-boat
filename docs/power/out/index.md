# out

I have identified the following power requirements, and have assumed 24
hour always on to provide an extra buffer to take into account such
extreme eventualities, ensuring that it's always possible to work no
matter what.

### power tools

This might be an area requiring an alternator

-   fridge ()

-   freezer

-   lights

-   workstation

-   monitors

-   navigation electronics

-   watermaker (reverse osmosis / desalination machine)

-   water heater

-   compute/networking

    -   satellite

    -   5g

    -   4g

    -   WiFi

    -   server

### Marine requirements

Without going into too much detail, the problem of electrifying a boat
is a solved issue, in that sense I refer the reader to such experts
[@boat-power-1] [@boat-power-2] [@boat-power-3] who estimate the maximum
power draw whilst at sea (which is when the most power is used) over a
24 hour period to be about 3000 Watt hours. In contrast, when at anchor
(The situation I anticipate being in on a daily basis during the work
week) this reduces by around 2/3rds to 1100 Watt hours. These figures
include very power hungry items such as an electric autopilot which I
intend not to use (in this case I'd prefer a wind-vane).

This figure takes into account all electronics except those required for
work, which I do below.
